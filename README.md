# Carvan_Insurnce_policy
<p>DESCRIPTION :  Classification problem<br>
Direct mailings to a companyâ€™s potential customers.
Junk mail is really of no interest to the
people who receives them. Most of it ends up thrown away, not only wasting the money that the company spent on it, but also filling up landfill waste sites or needing to be recycled.<br>
This project uses an ML model to <b>predict whether a customer is interested in a caravan insurance policy</b> from other data about the customer. If the company had a better understanding of who their potential customers were, they would know more accurately who to send it to, so some of this waste and expense could be reduced.
